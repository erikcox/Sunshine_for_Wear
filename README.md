## Tips for connecting to emulator

* Create an Android Wear AVD in Android studio and run it

* Install the Android Wear app from Google Play on a physical device and plug it into your machine via USB

* Forward the AVD's communication port to the connected phone (you must do this every time the phone is connected): `adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601`

* Start the Android Wear app on your phone and connect to the emulator.
